# craftcalculator


For FFXI Era private server.

Calculates best time to craft a given item.

If moon says 25% or 75% it means that percentage or HIGHER.

This calculator assumes you are always standing in NQ direction for the +.5 skill.

To use the addon type //cc skill difficulty

Where skill is the max skill you will be crafting with and difficulty is the difficulty of the synth.

i.e. //cc 105 94 

Pretty sure this is correct, if it seems wrong let me know.
